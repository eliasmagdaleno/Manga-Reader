//  The counts ADR-0004 ranks on. Counting a Listing means asking a source for its
//  whole chapter list — N round-trips, where the slowest source sets the wait — so
//  the count is cached and the detail page renders from the cache immediately.
//
//  Disposable by construction: losing this file costs one recount and nothing else,
//  which is why it lives in `Caches/` rather than beside the authoritative stores
//  in Application Support.
