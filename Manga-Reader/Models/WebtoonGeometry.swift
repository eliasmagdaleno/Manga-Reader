/// rather than merging: a frame from a derealized row is only valid at the scroll offset
/// it was taken at (ADR-0014 decision 8, second amendment).

/// `nil` means "unknown", and there are three ways to get it: nothing is measured yet,
/// nothing measured has a real height yet, or the strip under the viewport top has not
/// decoded. A caller must not read `nil` as "the top" — `record` would forgive it, but
