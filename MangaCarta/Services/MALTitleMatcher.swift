//
//  Pure title-matching core for cross-source entity resolution: given a source manga's
//  title and MAL search candidates (each with its full title set), decide which MAL id
//  it is — or that there's no confident match. No network, no persistence; fully unit-
//  tested. Precision-biased: a high threshold plus an ambiguity guard, and any doubt
//  resolves to `.noMatch` rather than a wrong id.
